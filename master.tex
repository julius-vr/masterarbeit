\chapter{Some PL topology}
\label{sec:Einleitung}

In this chapter we will collect some basic facts from the piecewise-linear category. Most of the proofs are omitted and can be found in standard references like \cite{pltopo}, \cite{hatcher}. If the reader is already familiar with basics from PL topology, the chapter may be skipped without loss of continuity.

\begin{definition}
Let $v_0,...,v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be points in some affine space such that $\{ v_1-v_0,...,v_k-v_0 \}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors. We call

\begin{equation*}
[v_0,...,v_k] := \Biggl \{  \lambda_0v_0+...+ \lambda_kv_k \Bigg |  \sum_{i=0}^k \lambda_i =1 \text{ and } \lambda_i \geq 0 \text{ for all i} \Biggr \}
\end{equation*}
the simplex spanned by $\{v_0,...,v_k \}$. Its dimension is $k$ and we call it a \textbf{$k$-simplex} for short. The points that span a simplex are called vertices. For a simplex $\sigma$ we say that $\tau$ is a \textbf{face} of $\sigma$ if $\tau$ is a simplex spanned by a nonempty subset of the vertices of $\sigma$ and we abbreviate this by writing $\tau < \sigma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{simplicial complex} $K$ is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every face of a simplex in $K$ is also contained in $K$.
\item The intersection of any two simplices $\sigma, \tau \in K$ is either empty or a face of both $\sigma$ and $\tau$.
\end{itemize}

We define the \textbf{plyhedron} of $K$ by $|K|:= \bigcup \{ \sigma | \sigma \in K \}$. A \textbf{subcomplex} of $K$ is a subset $L \subset K$ such that $L$ itself is a simplicial complex. The \textbf{p-skeleton} of $K$ is the subcomplex of $K$, given by $K_{(p)}= \{ \sigma \in  K | \text{dim}(\sigma) \leq p \}$. We denote the set of vertices of $K$ by $V(K)$. The \textbf{dimension} of $K$ is the largest dimension of any simplex contained in $K$. If no such maximum exists, we say that $K$ is of dimension $\infty$. $K$ is said to be of \textbf{pure dimension} $n$ if every simplex of $K$ is a face of some $n$-simplex in $K$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
Let $K$ be a simplicial complex of pure dimension $n$. The \textbf{boundary} $Bd(K)$ of $K$ is defined to be the (possibly empty) subcomplex of $K$ of pure dimension $n-1$, whose $(n-1)$-simplices are those $(n-1)$-simplices of $K$ which are incident to precisely one $n$-simplex in $K$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For a simplicial complex $K$ and a simplex $\sigma \in K$, we call
\begin{equation*}
St(\sigma,K)= \{ \rho \in K | \rho < \tau, \sigma < \tau \text{ for some } \tau \in K \}  
\end{equation*}
the \textbf{star} of $\sigma$ in $K$. The \textbf{link} of $\sigma$ in $K$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
Lk(\sigma,K) = \{ \rho \in St(\sigma,K) | \sigma \cap \rho = \emptyset \}.
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Suppose that there are two simplicial complexes $K$ and $K'$ such that $|K| = |K'|$. If every simplex of $K'$ is contained in some simplex of $K$, we say that $K'$ is a \textbf{subdivision} of $K$ and write $K' \lhd K$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
Given a simplicial complex $K$ there is always an inductive process that produces a subdivision of $K$. Assume that $K_{(p-1)}$ has already been subdivided and let $\sigma=[v_0,...,v_p]$ be a $p$-simplex in $K$. The point $\hat{\sigma}=\frac{1}{p+1} \sum_{i=0}^p v_i$ lies in the interior of $\sigma$ and is called its \textbf{barycenter}. The \textbf{barycentric subdivision} of $\sigma$ is the decomposition of $\sigma$ into the $p$-simplices $[\hat{\sigma},w_0,...,w_{p-1}]$ where, inductively, $[w_o,...,w_{p-1}]$ is a $(p-1)$-simplex in the barycentric subdivision of a face $[v_0,...,\overline{v_i},...,v_p]$. (In this notation, the vertex $v_i$ is omitted.) Continuing this procedure for every $p$-simplex $\sigma$ leads to a decomposition of all simplices in $K_{(p)}$. The induction starts at $p=0$ when the barycentric subdivision of a $0$-simplex $[v_0]$ is just $[v_0]$ itself. It is guaranteed that this process delivers a subdivision $K^1 \lhd K$, called the \textbf{first barycentric subdivision} of $K$. For details, see \cite{hatcher}. More generally, the $r$-th barycentric subdivision is inductively given by $K^r=(K^{r-1})^1$.
\end{example}


\begin{definition}
A topological space $X$ is said to be $\mathbf{triangulable}$ if there exists a simplicial complex $T$ and a homeomorphism $\phi : |T| \to X$. The triple $(T,X, \phi)$ is called a \textbf{triangulation} of $X$. In this situation we will simply say that $T$ is a triangulation of $X$, by abuse of notation.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
A \textbf{PL space} is a pair $(X,\mathcal{T})$ consisting of a topological space $X$ and a class $\mathcal{T}$ of locally finite triangulations of $X$ which satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $T \in \mathcal{T}$ then $T' \in \mathcal{T}$ for any subdivision $T' \lhd T$.
\item If $T,T' \in \mathcal{T}$ then there exists $T'' \in \mathcal{T}$ such that both $T'' \lhd T$ and $T'' \lhd T'$.
\end{itemize}
We will simply write $X$ for a PL space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ if there is no danger of confusion. A \textbf{closed PL subspace} of $X$ is a subcomplex of a suitable triangulation of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given simplicial complexes $K$ and $L$ we call a map $f: |K| \to |L|$ \textbf{simplicial} if $f$ maps each simplex of $K$ linearly onto some simplex of $L$. A map $g: |K| \to |L|$ between PL spaces  is said to be a \textbf{PL map} if there exist subdivisions $K' \lhd K$ and $L' \lhd L$ such that $g: K' \to L' $ is simplicial.
\end{definition}
Note that a simplicial map $f: K \to L$ is given by linear extension of a (set-theoretic) function $V(K) \to V(L)$.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{simplicial isomorphism} between two simplicial complexes $K$ and $L$ is given by a bijection $f : V(K) \to V(L)$ such that $[v_0,...,v_k]$ is a $k$-simplex in $K$ if and only if $[f(v_0),...,f(v_k)]$ is a $k$-simplex in $L$. In particular, extending $f$ linearly yields a homeomorphism between the underlying polyhedra $|K|$ and $|L|$. A map $g: |K| \to |L|$ between PL spaces is a \textbf{PL isomorphism} if there exist subdivisions $K' \lhd K$ and $L' \lhd L$ such that $g: |K'| \to |L'|$ is a simplicial isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}(Simplicial Approximation Theorem).
Let $f: |K| \to |L|$ be a map between polyhedra. Then there exist subdivisions $K' \lhd K$ and $L' \lhd L$ and a simplicial map $g: |K'| \to |L'|$ which is $\epsilon$-homotopic to $f$, i.e. if $\epsilon: |L| \to (0,\infty)$ is a map, then there is a map $H: |K| \times [0,1] \to |L|$ with $H(|K| \times \{ 0\})=f$, $H(|K| \times \{ 1\})=g$ and diam$(H(\{ x \} \times [0,1])) < \epsilon(f(x))$.

\chapter{A bordism approach to homology theories}
The purpose of this chapter is to give a geometric treatment of homology theories, as described by S. Buoncristiano, C. Rourke and B. Sanderson in \cite{BRS}. First we use local link properties to determine a class of polyhedra. Then, in an analagous manner to ordinary bordism theory, we define groups of bordism classes of maps, whose domains lie in the polyhedral class defined before. We observe that interesting examples of generalized homology theories can be interpreted in this way, including ordinary homology, ($\mathbb{Z}/2$)-homology and PL bordism theory. \newline
For the rest of this chapter we make the convention that every polyhedron is PL and of pure dimension.

\begin{definition}
Suppose we are given a class $\mathcal{L}_n$ of $(n-1)$-polyhedra which is closed under PL isomorphism. Then a \textbf{closed $\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold} is a polyhedron $M$ such that the link of each vertex of $M$ lies in $\mathcal{L}_n$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{theory}
A \textbf{theory with singularities} $\mathcal{L}$ consists of a class $\mathcal{L}_n$ of $(n-1)$-polyhedra for every $n=0,1,...$ which satisfy the following compatibility conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] each member of $\mathcal{L}_n$ is a closed $\mathcal{L}_{n-1}$-manifold.
\item[2.] $S \mathcal{L}_{n-1} \subset \mathcal{L}_n$ (i.e. the suspension of an $(n-1)$-link is always an $n$-link).
\item[3.] $c \mathcal{L}_{n-1} \cap \mathcal{L}_n = \emptyset$ (i.e. the cone of an $(n-1)$-link is never an $n$-link).
\item[4.] $S(c\mathcal{L}_{n-2}), c(c \mathcal{L}_{n-2}) \subset c \mathcal{L}_{n-1}$.
\end{itemize}
Then an \textbf{$\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold with boundary} consists of a polyhedron whose links of vertices lie either in $\mathcal{L}_n$ or in $c \mathcal{L}_{n-1}$. The \textbf{boundary} consists of the subpolyhedron spanned by vertices whose links lie in the latter class.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
Let $W$ be an $\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold with boundary in a fixed theory with singularities $\mathcal{L}$. Then the boundary of $W$, denoted by $\partial W$, is well-defined and is itself a closed $\mathcal{L}_{n-1}$-manifold.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By the third requirement of Def.\ref{theory}, the link of a vertex in $W$ is contained in $c \mathcal{L}_{n-1}$ if and only if it is not contained in $\mathcal{L}_n$. This shows that $\partial W$ is well-defined. For the second statement, note that $\partial W$ is a subpolyhedron by definition and that if $v$ is a vertex in $\partial W$ with $Lk(v,W)=cL$ for some $L \in \mathcal{L}_{n-1}$, then $Lk(v,\partial W) = L$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{bordismusdef}
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a theory with singularities and let $(X,A)$ be a pair of topological spaces (i.e. $A \subset X$ is a subspace). For two compact, oriented $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifolds (possibly with boundary) $P,Q$  assume that we are given continuous maps $f:(P, \partial P) \to (X,A)$ and $g:(Q , \partial Q) \to (X,A)$. An \textbf{oriented bordism} between $f$ and $g$ is a triple $(F,W,Z)$, where $W$ is a compact, oriented $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$-manifold with boundary, s.t. $\partial W \cong P \sqcup -Q \cup Z$, $Z$ is a compact, oriented $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold (possibly with boundary), s.t. $\partial Z\cong \partial P \sqcup - \partial Q$ and $F: (W,Z) \to (X,A)$ is a continuous map with $F _{|P} = f$ and $F_{|Q}=g$. If there exists a bordism between them, $f$ and $g$ are said to be \textbf{bordant} and we abbreviate this by writing $f \sim_{bord} g$. We call $F$ a \textbf{null-bordism} for $f$ if $Q= \emptyset$ and we say that $f$ is \textbf{null-bordant} if there exists a null-bordism for $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{isomorphiedef}
With the notation as in the previous definition, $f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)$ and $g: (Q, \partial Q) \to (X,A)$ are called \textbf{isomorphic} if there exists a PL isomorphism $h : P \to Q$ s.t. the diagram \newline
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
      (P, \partial P) \ar[rr]^h \ar[rd]_f  &     &  (Q, \partial Q) \ar[dl]^g  \\
                             &  (X,A)  &
  }
\end{xy}
\newline
commutes. Let $Isom_{i}^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$ be the set of isomorphism classes of maps $f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)$, where $P$ varies over all compact $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifolds of a fixed theory $\mathcal{L}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
The relation $\sim_{bord} $ is an equivalence relation on $Isom_{i}^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $[f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)] \in Isom_{i}^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$ and let $I=[0,1]$ denote the closed interval. The only links in $I$ are $S^0$ and $pt.$ and so there are four types of links in $P \times I$, namely $S^0 * L \cong SL,\  pt. * L \cong cL,\  S^0 * cL' \cong S(cL')$ and $pt. * cL' \cong c(cL')$, where $L \in \mathcal{L}_i$ and $L' \in \mathcal{L}_{i-1}$ are some links of $P$. The second statement of Def. \ref{theory} ensures that the first type of links is contained in $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$ and by the fourth statement all other types of links lie in $c \mathcal{L}_i$. There exists a canonical orientation of $P \times I$ s.t. $\partial (P \times I)= P \sqcup -P \cup \partial P \times I$. So, $P \times I$ is an oriented $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$-manifold and we define $F: (P \times I, \partial(P \times I)) \to (X,A)$ by $F(x,s)=f(x)$ for every $s \in I$. Then $f \sim_{bord} f$ via $F$ and this bordism is well-defined on the isomorphism class of $f$, which shows reflexivity. For symmetry, we only need to obersve that disjoint union commutes, up to isomorphism. Now suppose $f \sim_{bord} g$ and $g \sim_{bord} h$ via bordisms $F$ and $G$, respectively, where $g: (Q, \partial Q) \to (X,A)$, $F: (W,Z) \to (X,A)$ and $G: (W',Z') \to (X,A)$. If $W \cup_{Q} W'$ denotes the space obtained by glueing $W$ and $W'$ along $Q$, we let $H: W \cup_{Q} W' \to X$ be the unique map with $H_{|W} = F$ and $H_{|W'}=G$. If $v$ is any vertex in $Q$, we have $Lk(v,W)=cLk(v,Q)=Lk(v,W')$, and therefore $Lk(v,W \cup_{Q} W') = SLk(v,Q)$, which lies in $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$, by definition. Since the links of all other vertices remain unaltered, we see that $W \cup_{Q} W'$ is in fact an $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$-manifold, which clearly is compact, as $W$ and $W'$ are. Moreover, we have $\partial (W \cup_{Q} W')= dom(f) \sqcup -dom(h) \cup (Z \cup_{\partial Q} Z')$ with $\partial (Z \cup_{\partial Q} Z')= \partial (dom(f)) \sqcup - \partial (dom(h))$, and the same argument as before shows that $Z \cup_{\partial Q} Z'$ is an $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold. We conclude $f \sim_{bord} h$ via $H: (W \cup_{Q} W',Z \cup_{\partial Q} Z') \to (X,A)$, and again $H$ is a well-defined bordism on isomorphism classes of $f$ and $h$. This shows transitivity and completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{bordismgroup}
For a theory with singularities $\mathcal{L}$, we let  
\begin{equation*}
\Omega_i^\mathcal{L}(X,A)= Isom_i^\mathcal{L}(X,A)/ \sim_{bord}
\end{equation*}
 and call it the \textbf{$i$-th (relative) $\mathcal{L}$-bordism set} with base $(X,A)$. Moreover, we define
\begin{equation*}
\Omega_i^\mathcal{L}(X)=\Omega_i^\mathcal{L}(X, \emptyset)
\end{equation*}
and call it the \textbf{$i$-th (absolute) $\mathcal{L}$-bordism set} with base $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] There is an obvious notion of unoriented $\mathcal{L}$-bordism by removing all references to orientations. We denote the associated bordism sets by $\Omega_i^{\underline{\mathcal{L}}}(X,A)$.
\item[2.] For the absolute case, note that $\Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X)$ consists of bordism classes of maps $f: P \to X$, where $P$ is a, necessarily closed $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold. For some $g: Q \to X$, the bordism relation between $f$ and $g$ reduces to the existence of some compact, oriented $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$-manifold $W$ with $\partial W \cong P \sqcup -Q$ and a map $F: W \to X$ s.t. $F_{|P}=f$ and $F_{|Q}=g$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

So far, we have not discussed interactions of two $\mathcal{L}$-manifolds with each other. For example, the product of two $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifolds is not an $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold, in general. Howewer, the following is true:

\begin{prop}
$\Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$ is an abelian group with respect to disjoint union.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $[f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)], [g: (Q,\ \partial Q) \to (X,A)] \in \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$. Then $P \sqcup Q$ is an $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold, as the links are unaltered by disjoint union, and so $f \sqcup g: (P \sqcup Q, \partial P \sqcup \partial Q) \to (X,A)$ represents a class in $\Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$. Consequently, we let $[f] \sqcup [g]:= [f \sqcup g]$. Suppose that $f'$ and $g'$ are representatives of $[f]$ and $[g]$, respectively, via bordisms $F$ and $G$. Then $F \sqcup G$ is a bordism between $f \sqcup g$ and $f' \sqcup g'$, which shows that the above definition is a well-defined operation. Associativity and commutativity clearly hold. The identity element is given by the class of the empty map (and so by the class of any null-bordant map). If $[-f]$ denotes the class of $f$ with reversed orientation of its domain, we observe once again that $F: (P \times I, \partial(P \times I)) \to (X,A)$ with $F(x,s)=f(x)$ is a bordism between $f$ and $-f$. We conclude
\begin{equation*}
[f] \sqcup [-f] = [f \sqcup -f] = 0 
\end{equation*}
and so the inverse of $[f]$ is given by $[-f]$. In the unoriented setting, we can remark that every bordism class is self-inverse.
\end{proof}

The previous Proposition allows us to speak of bordism groups, rather than of bordism sets and we adapt this terminology for the rest of this discussion. \newline So far, we did not explain connections of $\mathcal{L}$-bordism groups for varying base spaces. This will be done in the following.

\begin{definition}
Let $\boldsymbol{CW^2}$ denote the category of pairs of finite CW spaces with continuous maps between them and let $\boldsymbol{AbGrp}$ be the category of abelian groups with group homomorphisms between them. Moreover, let $T$ denote the covariant functor on $\boldsymbol{CW^2}$, given by
\begin{align*}
&T(X,A) = (A, \emptyset) \text{, for any } (X,A) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2},  \\
&T(f) = f_{|(A, \emptyset)} : (A, \emptyset) \to (B, \emptyset) \text{, for any } f: (X,A) \to (Y,B) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}.
\end{align*}
A \textbf{generalized homology theory} is a pair $(H_*, \partial_*)$, consisting of a sequence of functors $H_i : \boldsymbol{CW^2} \to \boldsymbol{AbGrp}$, together with a sequence of natural transformations $\partial_i : H_i \to H_{i-1} \circ T$, s.t. the following three conditions are satisfied: \begin{itemize}
\item[1.] \textbf{Homotopy-invariance:} If $f,g \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$ are homotopic maps, then $H_i(f)=H_i(g)$ for all $i$.
\item[2.] \textbf{Excision:} Let $(X,A) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$ and suppose $U$ is a subspace of $X$ with $\overline{U} \subset int(A)$, then the inclusion $j: (X-U,A-U) \to (X,A)$ induces isomorphisms 
\begin{equation*}
j_* : H_i(X-U,A-U) \to H_i(X,A),
\end{equation*}
for all $i$.
\item[3.] \textbf{Long exact sequence:} If $(X,A) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$ and if $j: (A, \emptyset) \to (X, \emptyset)$ and $k: (X, \emptyset) \to (X,A)$ denote the inclusions, the sequence
\begin{equation*}
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{ 
\cdots \ar[r]^{}     &   H_{i+1}(X,A) \ar[r]^{\ \ \partial_{i+1}}    &   H_i(A) \ar[r]^{H_i(j)}   &  H_i(X) \\
  \ar[r]^{H_i(k)}   &   H_i(X,A)  \ar[r]^{\partial_i}   &   H_{i-1}(A) \ar[r]^{}   &   \cdots
}
\end{xy}
\end{equation*}
is exact, for all $i$.
\end{itemize}
A generalized homology theory $(H_*, \partial_*)$ is called \textbf{ordinary} if the following additional requirement holds:
\begin{itemize}
\item[4.] \textbf{Dimension:} $H_i(pt.)=0$ for $i \neq 0$. Then $H_0(pt.)$ is called the \textbf{coefficient group} of $H_*$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For a theory with singularities $\mathcal{L}$, the pair $(\Omega_*^{\mathcal{L}}, \partial_*)$ is a generalized homology theory, where 
\begin{align*}
\partial_i :\  \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A) &\to \Omega_{i-1}^{\mathcal{L}}(A) \\
[f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)] &\mapsto [f_{| \partial P}: \partial P \to A]
\end{align*}
for any pair $(X,A) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First, if $\phi : (X,A) \to (Y,B) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$, then the induced map of $\phi $ is given by
\begin{align*}
\phi_* : \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A) &\to \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(Y,B) \\
[f] &\mapsto [\phi \circ f],
\end{align*}
which is well-defined since if $F$ is a bordism over $(X,A)$, then $\phi \circ F$ is a bordism over $(Y,B)$. Moreover, this construction respects the corresponding group structures, behaves functorial and we have $(id)_*=id$. Similarly, $\partial_i$ is well-defined, as if $F:(W,Z) \to (X,A)$ is a bordism between $f$ and $g$ over $(X,A)$, then $F_{|Z}$ is a bordism between $f_{| \partial dom(f)}$ and $g_{| \partial dom(g)}$ over $A$. The maps $\partial_i$ are natural, as composition of maps commutes with restriction to the boundary. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Homotopy-invariance: Let $\phi, \psi : (X,A) \to (Y,B)$ be two homotopic maps via a homotopy $H$. For $[f] \in \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$, the map
\begin{equation*}
F: (dom(f) \times I) \to (X,A) 
\end{equation*}
with $F(x,s)=H(f(x),s)$ is a bordism between $\phi \circ f$ and $\psi \circ f$ (with reversed orientation of its domain). So, we have
\begin{align*}
\phi_* ([f]) = [\phi \circ f] = [\psi \circ f] = \psi_* ([f])
\end{align*}
and since $[f]$ was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude $\phi_*= \psi_*$.
\item[2.] Excision: For $(X,A) \in \boldsymbol{CW^2}$ and $U \subset A$ with $\overline{U} \subset int(A)$, let 
\begin{equation*}
j_i: \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X-U, A-U) \to \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)
\end{equation*}
denote the map induced by inclusion. We will show that $j_i$ is an isomorphism. To see surjectivity, consider $[f: (P, \partial P) \to (X,A)] \in \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$ and let $U_1 = f^{-1}(U)$ and $A_1= f^{-1}(A)$. We choose a triangulation $T$ of $P$, fine enough such that the smallest subcomplex of $T$ which contains every simplex that meets $M-A_1$, is contained in $M-U_1$. This is possible, since $d(M-int(A_1), \overline{U_1})>0$ for any metric $d$ on $P$. If we denote this subcomplex by $K$, note that for any vertex $v \in K$ either $Lk(v,K)=Lk(v,T)$ or, by the first condition of Def. \ref{theory}, there exists a vertex $w \in L:= Lk(v,T)$ such that $Lk(w,L)=Lk(v,Bd(K))$. It follows that
\begin{align*}
Lk(v,K) = w * Lk(v,Bd(K)) = w * Lk(w,L) \cong c(Lk(w,L))
\end{align*}
and since $Lk(w,L) \in \mathcal{L}_{i-1}$, $|K|$ is in fact an $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifold. By construction, $f_1:=f|_{|K|}$ defines a class in $\Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X-U,A-U)$ and 
\begin{align*}
F: \frac{P \times I}{ (P-|K|) \times \{ 1 \} } &\to (X,A) \\
(x,s) &\mapsto f(x)
\end{align*}
defines a bordism between $f$ and $f_1$ over $(X,A)$. Consequently, we have $j_i ([f_1]) = [f]$. For injectivity, suppose $j_i([f])=0$ and let $F$ be the corresponding null-bordism for $f$ over $(X,A)$. Then, the same construction as before applied to $F$ provides a null-bordism $F_1$ for $f$ over $(X-U,A-U)$, which shows $[f]=0$.
\item[3.] Long exact sequence: For some $i \geq 0$, let \\

\\
be the sequence of the induced maps of inclusions $j,k$ and restriction map $\partial_i$. \\
{$im(j_i) = ker(k_i):$} If $[f:P \to A] \in \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(A)$, then $F: (P \times I, -P) \to (X,A)$ with $F(x,s)=f(x)$ is a null-bordism for $f$ over $(X,A)$, which shows $k_i \circ j_i = 0$. Now, suppose that $[g: Q \to X] \in \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}}(X)$ with $k_i([g])=0$. This means that there exists a null-bordism $G: (W,Z) \to (X,A)$ for $g$ over $(X,A)$. We then have 
\begin{align*}
j_i([G_{|Z}: -Z \to A]) = [g],
\end{align*}
as $G: W \to X$ is a bordism between $G_{|Z}$ and $g$ over $X$. \\
$im(k_i)=ker(\partial_i):$ Since $\partial_i \circ k_i$ is given by restriction to an empty boundary, $\partial_i \circ k_i=0$ is obvious. On the other hand, if 
\begin{align*}
\partial_i([f:(P, \partial P) \to (X,A)])= [f_{| \partial P} : \partial P \to A] = 0,
\end{align*}
there exists a null-bordism $F: W \to A$ for $f_{| \partial P}$ over $A$. In particular, we have $\partial W= \partial P$. Let $Q$ denote the cylinder $P \times I$, in which we add $W$ by glueing it along the boundary of $P \times \{ 0 \}$. Then $Q$ is an $\mathcal{L}_{i+1}$-manifold with $P$ and $P \cup_{\partial P} W$ sitting inside its boundary. We define the map $G: Q \to X$ to be $f$ on every level of the cylinder and to be $F$ on $W$. The condition $F_{| \partial W}=f_{| \partial P}$ ensures that $G$ is well-defined and continuous. Moreover, $G$ is a bordism between $G_{|P \cup_{\partial P} W}$ and $f$ over $(X,A)$ and since $P \cup_{\partial P} W$ has no boundary, we conclude 
\begin{align*}
k_i([G_{|P \cup_{\partial P} W}])=[f].
\end{align*}
$im(\partial_i)= ker(j_{i-1}):$ If $[f:(P, \partial P) \to (X,A)] \in \Omega_{i}^{\mathcal{L}}(X,A)$, we have 
\begin{align*}
j_{i-1} \circ \partial_i ([f])= [f_{| \partial P}: \partial P \to X] = 0,
\end{align*}
as a null-bordism over $X$ is given by $f$. For the other implication, consider $[g: Q \to A] \in \Omega_{i-1}^{\mathcal{L}}(A)$ with $j_{i-1}([g])=0$. If $G: W \to X$ is a corresponding null-bordism over $X$, it follows that
\begin{align*}
\partial_i([G: (W,Q) \to (X,A)]) = [g],
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
which shows exactness of the sequence and completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Next, we will give examples of classes $\mathcal{L}$ that determine the corresponding bordism theory $\Omega_*^{\mathcal{L}}$.

\begin{example}
Consider the class of links $\mathcal{L}$, given by $\mathcal{L}_0 := \{ \emptyset \}$, $\mathcal{L}_n:= \{ X | X \cong S^{n-1} \}$ for $n \geq 1$. Then a closed $\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold is a polyhedron $M$ of dimension $n$, in which every vertex $v$ has a PL sphere as its link. Therefore $M$ is a closed PL manifold, as a small open neighborhood of $v$ is PL isomorphic to an open PL ball. Similarly, an $\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold with boundary is simply an $n$-dimensional PL manifold with boundary, and so the associated theory $\Omega_*^{\mathcal{L}}$ is "ordinary" (oriented) PL bordism theory, denoted by $\Omega_*^{PL}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
We define a class of links $\mathcal{L}$ as follows: $\mathcal{L}_0 := \{ \emptyset \}$, $\mathcal{L}_1 := \{ X|X \cong S^0 \}$, and for $n \geq 2$ we let $\mathcal{L}_n$ be the class of \textbf{all} closed $\mathcal{L}_{n-1}$-manifolds. We would like to compute the coefficient group $\Omega_*^{\mathcal{L}}(pt.)$. For this, note that an $\mathcal{L}_0$-manifold is a disjoint union of points and an $\mathcal{L}_1$-manifold with boundary is a disjoint union of (closed) intervals and circles. This means that a point does not bound in $\mathcal{L}$, and so generates 
$\Omega_0^{\mathcal{L}}(pt.) \cong \mathbb{Z}.$ Moreover, if $P$ is a closed $\mathcal{L}_n$-manifold for $n \geq 1$, then $cP$ is an $\mathcal{L}_{n+1}$-manifold with boundary. Indeed, let $c$ denote the cone point. Then $Lk(c,cP)=P \in \mathcal{L}_{n+1}$ and if $v$ denotes some other vertex of $cP$, then $v$ lies in $P$ and if $L:=Lk(v,P)$, we have $Lk(v,cP)=cL$, which is the cone on a link in $\mathcal{L}_n$. This also shows, that the boundary of $cP$ consists of $P$, and so $P$ bounds in $\mathcal{L}$. We conclude $\Omega_n^{\mathcal{L}}(pt.)=0$ and denote the corresponding theory by $\Omega_*^{ord}$. Note that in the unoriented setting of the same class, the higher coefficient groups still vanish. But in difference to the oriented case, we have $\Omega_0^{\underline{\mathcal{L}}}(pt.)= \mathbb{Z}/2$, since the disjoint union of two points is then the boundary of an interval. We denote the unoriented theory associated to $\mathcal{L}$ by $\Omega_*^{ord}(-; \mathbb{Z}/2)$. As the previous two generalized homology theories additionally satisfy the dimension axiom, these represent ordinary homology theory with $\mathbb{Z}$- and $\mathbb{Z}/2$-coefficients, respectively.
\end{example}

\chapter{The basic sets $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$}
In this chapter we will define and study the so called "basic sets", originally introduced by M. Goresky and R. McPherson in \cite{GM}. Given a stratified PL pseudomanifold $X$ and a perversity $\overline{p}$, we construct subpolyhedra $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ of $X$ for every $i \geq 0$. They are designed to give a connection between ordinary homology groups of these basic sets and the intersection homology groups of the whole space $X$. \\
We begin with a brief introduction to PL intersection homology theory.

\section{Intersection Homology}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{0-dimensional PL stratified pseudomanifold} is a countable set of points with the discrete topology. An \textbf{n-dimensional PL stratified pseudomanifold} $X$ is a PL space together with a filtration of closed PL subspaces
\begin{equation*}
X=X_n \supset X_{n-1} = X_{n-2} \supset ... \supset X_0 \supset X_{-1} = \emptyset
\end{equation*}
such that the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every $X_{n-k} - X_{n-k-1}$ is a (possibly empty) PL manifold of dimension $n-k$.
\item $X-X_{n-2}$ is dense in $X$.
\item \textbf{Local normal triviality:} For every point $x \in X_{n-k} - X_{n-k-1}$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$  in $X$ and a compact PL stratified pseudomanifold $L$ of dimension $k-1$ with filtration
\begin{equation*}
L = L_{k-1} \supset L_{k-3} \supset ... \supset L_0 \supset L_{-1}= \emptyset
\end{equation*}
and a PL isomorphism
\begin{equation*}
\phi : U \to \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \times c^{\circ} L
\end{equation*}
(where $c^{\circ}$ denotes the open cone) which restricts to PL isomorphism $\phi_| : U \cap X_{n-l} \to \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \times c^{\circ} L_{k-l-1}$. We say that $\phi$ is \textbf{stratum-preserving}.
\end{itemize}
A closed subset $X_{n-k}$ occuring in the filtration of $X$ is called \textbf{stratum} of codimension $k$. We call $X_{n-k}-X_{n-k-1}$ the \textbf{pure stratum} of codimension $k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a PL space and $T$ be an admissible triangulation for $X$. Let $C_i^{T}(X)$ denote the free abelian group, generated by all ordered $i$-simplices of $T$. Suppose $T' \lhd T$ is a subdivision. If $\xi \in C_i^T(X)$, we can assign a canonical element $\xi' \in C_i^{T'}(X)$ by mapping each generator $\sigma \in C_i^T(X)$ to $\sum_{\sigma' \in T' , \sigma' \subset \sigma} \sigma' $ and extending linearly.
This yields a map
\begin{align*}
C_i^T(X) \to C_i^{T'}(X),
\end{align*}
which we call the canonical map. Now, define
\begin{align*}
C_i(X) := colim \ C_i^T(X),
\end{align*}
where the colimit ranges over all triangulations of the PL structure of $X$, with respect to the canonical maps. In other words, $C_i(X)$ consists of equivalence classes, represented by elements $\xi \in C_i^T(X)$, where $\xi$ and $\xi' \in C_i^{T'}(X)$ are equivalent if there is a common admissible subdivision $T''$ of $T$ and $T'$, such that the images of $\xi$ and $\xi'$ under the canonical maps coincide in $C_i^{T''}(X)$. For any $i$, the simplicial boundary maps (see. \cite{hatcher}, ch.2)
\begin{align*}
\partial_i^T: C_i^T(X) \to C_{i-1}^T(X)
\end{align*}
give rise to boundary maps 
\begin{align*}
\partial_i : C_i(X) \to C_{i-1}(X)
\end{align*}
which satisfy $\partial_i \circ \partial_{i-1}=0$. The associated homology groups
\begin{align*}
H_i(X):= H_i(C_*(X))
\end{align*}
are called \textbf{PL homology} groups of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{perversity} is a function $\overline{p}: \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\overline{p}(2)=0$,
\item $\overline{p}(k) \leq \overline{p}(k+1) \leq \overline{p}(k)+1$.
\end{itemize}
Given two perversities $\overline{p}, \overline{q}$, we write $\overline{p} \leq \overline{q}$ if $\overline{p}(k) \leq \overline{q}(k)$ for every $k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
There are at least four important perversities:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{zero perversity} $\overline{0}$, defined as $\overline{0}(k)=0$ for all $k$.
\item The \textbf{lower-middle perversity} $\overline{m}= \{ 0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,... \}$
\item The \textbf{upper-middle perversity} $\overline{n}= \{ 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,... \}$
\item The \textbf{top perversity} $\overline{t}$, given by $\overline{t}(k)=k-2$ for all $k$.
\end{itemize}
Two perversities $\overline{p}, \overline{q}$ are said to be \textbf{complementary} if $\overline{p}+ \overline{q}= \overline{t}$.
\end{example}


For the rest of this chapter, let $X$ be a fixed PL stratified pseudomanifold of dimension $n$ with strata $X_{n-k}$  and let $\overline{p}$ be a perversity.

\begin{definition}
A subspace $Y \subset X$ is said to be \textbf{$(\overline{p},i)$-allowable} if $dim(Y) \leq i$ and $dim(Y \cap X_{n-k}) \leq i+(n-k)-n+ \overline{p}(k)=i-k+\overline{p}(k)$, for all $k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For a triangulation $T$ of $X$ and $\xi \in C_i^T(X)$ let $|\xi|$ denote the \textbf{support} of $\xi$, i.e. the union of those simplices in $T$, which have non-zero coefficients in $\xi$. Suppose $T' \lhd T$ is an admissible subdivision of $T$ and $\xi' \in C_i^{T'}(X)$ is the image of $\xi$ under the canonical map. Then $|\xi|=|\xi'|$, and so any element $\alpha \in C_i(X)$ has a well-defined support $|\alpha|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $IC_i^{\overline{p}}(X)$ be the subgroup of $C_i(X)$ consisting of those chains $\xi$ such that $|\xi|$ is $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable and $|\partial \xi|$ is $(\overline{p},i-1)$-allowable. Then the boundary maps of the complex $C_*(X)$ restrict to boundary maps
\begin{align*}
\partial_i : IC_i^{\overline{p}}(X) \to IC_{i-1}^{\overline{p}}(X)
\end{align*}
by the constraint on the boundaries of elements in $IC_i^{\overline{p}}(X)$. Therefore, we have a chain complex $(IC_*^{\overline{p}}(X),\partial_*)$, and we define
\begin{align*}
IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X):=H_i(IC_*^{\overline{p}}(X))
\end{align*}
to be the $i$-th \textbf{intersection homology} group of $X$, for perversity $\overline{p}$.
\end{definition}

\section{Basic sets}

For the PL stratified pseudomanifold $X^n$, we fix an admissible triangulation $T$ if not otherwise stated. By $T^1$, we denote the first barycentric subdivision of $T$ and the $p$-skeleton of $T$ is denoted by $T_{(p)}$, as usual.

\begin{definition}
For each $i \geq 0$ and fixed perversity $\overline{p}$ we define a function $L_i^{\overline{p}}: \{ 0,...,n+1 \} \to \mathbb{N}$ as follows: 
\begin{align*}
L_i^{\overline{p}}(0)=i,\ \ L_i^{\overline{p}}(1)=i-1,\ \ L_i^{\overline{p}}(n+1)=-1,
\end{align*}
and for $2 \leq c \leq n$ we let
\begin{align*}
L_i^{\overline{p}}(c)=
\begin{cases}
-1 &\text{ if $i-c+p(c) \leq -1$}  \\
n-c &\text{ if $i-c+p(c) \geq n-c$ } \\
i-c+p(c) &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Furthermore, let $\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(c)=L_i^{\overline{p}}(c) - L_i^{\overline{p}}(c+1)$. Then the \textbf{i-th basic set} $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ of $X$ with respect to $T$ is the subcomplex of $T^1$, which is spanned by the following set of barycenters of simplices in $T$:
\begin{align*}
\{ \hat{\sigma} | \sigma \in T,\ \Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(n-dim(\sigma))=1\}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

From now on we will consider basic sets $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ with respect to a fixed triangulation $T$ of $X$ without further mention.

\begin{remark}\label{remarkbasic}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Note that $L_i^{\overline{p}}(c)$ represents the largest possible dimension of intersection of any $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable set with $X_{n-c}$.
\item[2.] Using the perversity restriction $\overline{p}(c) \leq \overline{p}(c+1) \leq \overline{p}(c)+1$, a simple case distinction shows that $\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(c)$ is either $0$ or $1$.
\item[3.] A similar distinction shows that if $\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(c)=1$, then $\Delta_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}(c)=1$. We conclude that $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ is a subcomplex of $Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{prop}\label{dimensionbasicset}
For any $k$-simplex $\sigma \in T$,  we have 
\begin{align*}
dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma)= L_i^{\overline{p}}(n-k).
\end{align*}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
If $\sigma^1$ denotes the first barycentric subdivision of $\sigma$, then $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma$ is a subcomplex of $\sigma^1$, spanned by barycenters of faces $\tau < \sigma$ with $\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(n-dim(\tau))=1$. If $\tau_0 < \tau_1 < ... < \tau_{k-1} < \tau_k:= \sigma$ is a sequence of faces, where each $\tau_j$ is a $j$-simplex, then under consideration of Rem.\ref{remarkbasic}.2. a top-dimensional simplex in $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma$ is spanned by 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{j=0}^k \Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(n-dim(\tau_j)) = \sum_{j=0}^k \Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(n-j &)= L_i^{\overline{p}}(n-k) - L_i^{\overline{p}}(n+1) \\ &=L_i^{\overline{p}}(n-k) +1
\end{align*}
vertices, and so $dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma)= L_i^{\overline{p}}(n-k).$
\end{proof}

\begin{corollar}
$Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ is of dimension $i$.
\end{corollar}

\begin{proof}
For any $n$-simplex $\sigma \in T$, we have $dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma)=L_i^{\overline{p}}(0)=i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemmabasicsets}
For complementary perversities $\overline{p}$ and $\overline{q}$, the equation
\begin{align*}
L_i^{\overline{p}}(c) + L_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}(c)=n-c-1
\end{align*}
holds for $2 \leq c \leq n+1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We begin with the case $-1 \leq i-c + \overline{p}(c) \leq n-c$. Using $\overline{p}(c)+ \overline{q}(c)=c-2$, we observe that this holds if and only if $-1 \leq n-i+1-c + \overline{q}(c) \leq n-c$, and so in this case we obtain
\begin{align*}
L_i^{\overline{p}}(c) + L_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}(c)=i-c+ \overline{p}(c)+ n-i+1-c+ \overline{q}(c)   =n-c-1.
\end{align*}
Now assume $i-c + \overline{p}(c) \leq -1$. Once again, we use the perversity constraint and see that this holds if and only if $n-i+1-c+ \overline{q}(c) \geq n-c$. We then have
\begin{align*}
L_i^{\overline{p}}(c) + L_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}(c)=-1 + n-c =n-c-1.
\end{align*}
Now the last case follows by symmetry, as $n-(n-i+1)+1=i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{retractions}
For $i \geq 1$ and complementary perversities $\overline{p}$ and $\overline{q}$ there are simplex-preserving deformation retractions
\begin{align*}
&X-(Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}} \cap |T_{(n-2)}|) \to Q_i^{\overline{p}} , \\
&X- Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}} \to Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap |T_{(n-2)}|.
\end{align*}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For any $i \geq 1$ we have $\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(0)=\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(1)=1$, since $\overline{p}(2)=0$. This means that the barycenter $\hat{\sigma}$ of $\sigma$ is a vertex of $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$, whenever $dim(\sigma) \geq n-1$. If, on the other hand, $2 \leq c \leq n+1$, then
\begin{align*}
\Delta_i^{\overline{p}}(c)+ \Delta_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}(c)=1,
\end{align*}
by Lemma \ref{lemmabasicsets}. Thus, if $dim(\sigma) \leq n-2$, then $\hat{\sigma}$ is a vertex in precisely one of $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ and $Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}$. We conclude that the set of vertices in $T^1$ which span $Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}} \cap |T_{(n-2)}|$ is exactly the complement of the set of vertices that span $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$. Therefore, every simplex of $T^1$ is the join of its intersection with $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$, and of its intersection with $Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}} \cap |T_{(n-2)}|$. Then the first retraction is given in each simplex of $T^1$ by retracting along these join lines. For the second retraction, observe that the above argument also shows that the set of vertices which span $Q_{n-i+1}^{\overline{q}}$ is the complement of the set of vertices which span $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap |T_{(n-2)}|$, and then construct it as before.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A triangulation $T$ of a PL stratified pseudomanifold $X$ is called \textbf{subordinate to the stratification} if each stratum $X_k$ is a subcomplex of $T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that triangulations subordinate to the stratification of $X$ necessarily exist in our setting, since the strata $X_k$ are closed PL subspaces and since two admissible triangulations always have a common admissible subdivision. Even more, for two stratifications of $X$ there exists a triangulation subordinate to both.
\end{remark}

One import reason for our interest in the basic sets is the following geometric result.

\begin{prop}\label{basicsetsallowable}
Assume that $T$ is a triangulation subordinate to the stratification of $X$. Let $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$
denote the basic sets with respect to this triangulation. Then $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ is $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma \subset X_{n-k}$ be a simplex. We know that $\sigma \in T$, since $X_{n-k}$ is a subcomplex of $T$. Then either $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma= \emptyset$ or, in view of Prop.\ref{dimensionbasicset},
\begin{align*}
dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap X_{n-k} \cap \sigma) &=dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma)=L_i^{\overline{p}}(n-dim(\sigma)) \\ &\leq i - (n- dim(\sigma))+ \overline{p}(n-dim(\sigma)) \\ &\leq i-k+ \overline{p}(k),
\end{align*}
where the first inequality holds under the assumption that $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap \sigma \neq \emptyset$ and the second inequality is ensured by $dim(\sigma) \leq n-k$ and by the perversity constraint $\overline{p}(c+1) \leq \overline{p}(c)+1$. Maximizing over all simplices $\sigma \in X_{n-k}$ shows
$dim(Q_i^{\overline{p}} \cap X_{n-k} ) \leq i-k+ \overline{p}(k).$
\end{proof}

Now suppose that the basic sets $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ are constructed with respect to a triangulation $T$ subordinate to the stratification of $X$. Let 
\begin{align*}
H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})
\end{align*}
be the map in PL homology which is induced by the inclusion $Q_i^{\overline{p}} \subset Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}$. Under consideration of naturality of the induced chain morphism $C_*(Q_i^{\overline{p}}) \to C_*(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})$, we see that an element $\alpha \in Im(H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}))$ is represented by $\sigma+ \partial \eta$, where $\sigma \in C_i(Q_i^{\overline{p}})$ is a cycle and $\eta \in  C_{i+1}(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})$
is some chain with $\partial \eta \in C_i(Q_i^{\overline{p}})$. By Prop.$\ref{basicsetsallowable}$, this means that $\sigma$ is a cycle in $IC_i^{\overline{p}}(X)$ and $\eta \in IC_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}(X)$, and so $\alpha$ defines an intersection homology class. Thus, we have a well-defined homomorphism
\begin{align*}
\Psi: Im(H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})) \to IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X).
\end{align*}

\begin{theorem}\label{theorembasicsets}
In the setting of the discussion above, the map
\begin{align*}
\Psi: Im(H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})) \to IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X).
\end{align*}
is an isomorphism for any $i \geq 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
See \cite{GM}, p.148. The proof makes use of the retractions from Prop.\ref{retractions}. We omit it as we use a similar technique later.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollar}
The groups $IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X)$ are independent of the stratification of $X$.
\end{corollar}

\begin{proof}
For two stratifications of $X$, there is a triangulation $T$ of $X$ subordinate to both. If we construct the basic sets with respect to $T$, the previous theorem applies and shows that for either stratification, $IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X)$ is isomorphic to $Im(H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollar}\label{IHindependentstrat}
If $T$ is an arbitrary triangulation of $X$ and if the $Q_i^{\overline{p}}$ are defined with respect to $T$, then
\begin{align*}
IH_i^{\overline{p}}(X) \cong Im(H_i(Q_{i}^{\overline{p}}) \to H_i(Q_{i+1}^{\overline{p}})).
\end{align*}
\end{corollar}

\begin{proof}
The skeleta of $T$ provide a stratification
\begin{align*}
X= |T_{(n)}| \supset |T_{(n-2)}| \supset |T_{(n-3)}| \supset \cdots \supset |T_{(0)}|
\end{align*}
for $X$, and clearly $T$ is subordinate to this stratification. Now Cor.$\ref{IHindependentstrat}$ gives the desired result.
\end{proof}

Note that the connection of ordinary homology and intersection homology that appears in Thm.\ref{theorembasicsets} gives another interpretation of intersection homology without making use of the intersection chain complex. The price one has to pay is the complicated construction of the basic sets. Nevertheless, this seems to be a good starting point to implement generalized intersection homology theories.

\chapter{Intersection Bordism}
Throughout this chapter, let $X$ be a PL stratified pseudomanifold and let $\overline{p}$ be a fixed perversity, unless stated otherwise. \\ 

DIMENSION DEF. DARUNTER
 
\begin{definition}
For a PL space $P$, a map $f: P \to X$ is called \textbf{($\boldsymbol{\overline{p}}$,i)-allowable} if 
\begin{align*}
dim(f(P) \cap X_{n-k}) \leq i-k+ \overline{p}(k)
\end{align*}
for all strata $X_{n-k}$ of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that any representative of the isomorphism class (in the sense of Def.\ref{isomorphiedef}) of a $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable map is $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable as well. Indeed, consider a commutative diagram
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
      P \ar[rr]^h \ar[rd]_f  &     &  Q \ar[dl]^g  \\
                             &  X &
  }
\end{xy}
with a PL isomorphism $h$ and assume $f$ to be $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable. We then have
\begin{align*}
dim(g(Q) \cap X_{n-k}) = dim(f \circ h^{-1} (Q) \cap X_{n-k})=dim(f(P) \cap X_{n-k}) \leq i-k+ \overline{p}(k).
\end{align*}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a theory with singularities (as in ch.2). Given two $\mathcal{L}_i$-manifolds $P,Q$ and maps $f: P \to X$ and $g: Q \to X$, we say that $f$ and $g$ are \textbf{oriented ($\boldsymbol{\overline{p}}$,i+1)-bordant} if $f$ and $g$ are bordant (in the sense of Def.$\ref{bordismusdef}$) via an oriented $({\overline{p}}$,i+1)-allowable bordism. In this situation, we write $f \sim_{i+1}^{\overline{p}} g$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $\mathcal{L}$ is a theory with singularities, let $Isom_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X)$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of maps $f: P \to X$ which are oriented $(\overline{p},i+1)$-bordant to a $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable map, where $P$ varies over all closed, compact, oriented $\mathcal{L}_i$- manifolds.
\end{definition}


\begin{prop}\label{intersectioneqrelation}
$\sim_{i+1}^{\overline{p}}$ is an equivalence relation on $Isom_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $[f] \in Isom_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X)$. Then $f$ is $(\overline{p},i+1)$-bordant to some $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable map via a bordism $F$, say. Since $F_{|dom(f)}=f$, we observe
\begin{align*}
dim(im(f) \cap X_{n-k}) = dim(im(F_{|dom(f)}) \cap X_{n-k}) &\leq dim(im(F) \cap X_{n-k}) \\ &\leq i+1-k+ \overline{p}(k).
\end{align*}
So, $f$ is $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable and we can define a $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable map \begin{align*}
F: dom(f) \times I \to X
\end{align*} by setting $F(x,s)=f(x)$. We have $\partial(dom(f) \times I)= dom(f) \times \{ 0 \} \sqcup -dom(f) \times \{  1 \}$, and clearly $F_{|dom(f) \times \{  0 \} }=F_{|dom(f) \times \{  1 \} } = f$. This proves reflexivity of the relation. For symmetry, note once more that disjoint union commutes up to isomorphism. To see transitivity, let $f \sim_{i+1}^{\overline{p}} g$ and $g \sim_{i+1}^{\overline{p}} h$ via bordisms $F$ and $G$, respectively. Let
\begin{align*}
H: dom(F) \cup_{dom(g)} dom(G) \to X
\end{align*}
be the unique map with $H_{|dom(F)}=F$ and $H_{|dom(G)}=G$, obtained by glueing along $dom(g)$. Then $H$ is $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable, since
\begin{align*}
dim(im(H) \cap X_{n-k}) &= dim((im(F) \cup im(G)) \cap X_{n-k})\\ & = dim(im(F) \cap X_{n-k} \cup im(G) \cap X_{n-k}) \\ &= max(dim(im(F) \cap X_{n-k}), dim(im(G) \cap X_{n-k})) \\ &\leq i+1-k+ \overline{p}(k),
\end{align*}
where the last inequality holds as $F$ and $G$ are both $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
For a theory with singularities $\mathcal{L}$, we define the corresponding i-th \textbf{intersection bordism set} with respect to $\overline{p}$ by 
\begin{align*}
I \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X) := Isom_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X)/ \sim_{i+1}^{\overline{p}} .
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
$I \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X) $ is an abelian group with respect to disjoint union.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $[f],[g] \in I \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X) $ with $f$ and $g$ both $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable. Then $f \sqcup g$ is $(\overline{p},i)$-allowable for the same reason as in the proof of transitivity in Prop.$\ref{intersectioneqrelation}$. This argument also shows that $\sqcup$ is a well-defined operation on $I \Omega_i^{\mathcal{L}, \overline{p}}(X)$: Let $f' \in [f],g' \in [g]$ be different representatives. Then there are bordisms $F$ between $f$ and $f'$, $G$ between $g$ and $g'$, both $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable. This leads to a $(\overline{p},i+1)$-allowable bordism $F \sqcup G$ between $f \sqcup g$ and $f' \sqcup g'$, and so it makes sense to define $[f] \sqcup [g]:=[f \sqcup g]$. As usual, the zero element is given by $[\emptyset \to X]$ and the inverse of $[f: P \to X]$ is $[f: -P \to X]$. Associativity and commutativity clearly hold.
\end{proof}
