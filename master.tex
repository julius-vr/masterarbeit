\chapter{Some PL topology}
\label{sec:Einleitung}

In this chapter we will collect some basic facts from the piecewise-linear category. Most of the proofs are omitted and can be found in standard references like \cite{pltopo}, \cite{hatcher}. If the reader is already familiar with basics from PL topology, the chapter may be skipped without loss of continuity.

\begin{definition}
Let $v_0,...,v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be points in some affine space such that $\{ v_1-v_0,...,v_k-v_0 \}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors. We call

\begin{equation*}
[v_0,...,v_k] := \Biggl \{  \lambda_0v_0+...+ \lambda_kv_k \Bigg |  \sum_{i=0}^k \lambda_i =1 \text{ and } \lambda_i \geq 0 \text{ for all i} \Biggr \}
\end{equation*}
the simplex spanned by $\{v_0,...,v_k \}$. Its dimension is $k$ and we call it a \textbf{$k$-simplex} for short. The points that span a simplex are called vertices. For a simplex $\sigma$ we say that $\tau$ is a \textbf{face} of $\sigma$ if $\tau$ is a simplex spanned by a nonempty subset of the vertices of $\sigma$ and we abbreviate this by writing $\tau < \sigma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{simplicial complex} $K$ is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every face of a simplex in $K$ is also contained in $K$.
\item The intersection of any two simplices $\sigma, \tau \in K$ is either empty or a face of both $\sigma$ and $\tau$.
\end{itemize}

We define the \textbf{plyhedron} of $K$ by $|K|:= \bigcup \{ \sigma | \sigma \in K \}$. The \textbf{p-skeleton} of $K$ is given by $K^{(p)}= \{ \sigma \in  K | \text{dim}(\sigma) \leq p \}$. A \textbf{subcomplex} of $K$ is a subset $L \subset K$ such that $L$ itself is a simplicial complex. We denote the set of vertices of $K$ by $V(K)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
Suppose that there are two simplicial complexes $K$ and $K'$ such that $|K| = |K'|$. If every simplex of $K'$ is contained in some simplex of $K$, we say that $K'$ is a \textbf{subdivision} of $K$ and write $K' \lhd K$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
Given a simplicial complex $K$ there is always an inductive process that produces a subdivision of $K$. Assume that $K^{(p-1)}$ has already been subdivided and let $\sigma=[v_0,...,v_p]$ be a $p$-simplex in $K$. The point $\hat{\sigma}=\frac{1}{p+1} \sum_{i=0}^p v_i$ lies in the interior of $\sigma$ and is called its \textbf{barycenter}. The \textbf{barycentric subdivision} of $\sigma$ is the decomposition of $\sigma$ into the $p$-simplices $[\hat{\sigma},w_0,...,w_{p-1}]$ where, inductively, $[w_o,...,w_{p-1}]$ is a $(p-1)$-simplex in the barycentric subdivision of a face $[v_0,...,\overline{v_i},...,v_p]$. (In this notation, the vertex $v_i$ is omitted.) Continuing this procedure for every $p$-simplex $\sigma$ leads to a decomposition of all simplices in $K^{(p)}$. The induction starts at $p=0$ when the barycentric subdivision of a $0$-simplex $[v_0]$ is just $[v_0]$ itself. It is guaranteed that this process delivers a subdivision $K^1 \lhd K$, called the \textbf{first barycentric subdivision} of $K$. For details, see \cite{hatcher}. More generally, the $r$-th barycentric subdivision is inductively given by $K^r=(K^{r-1})^1$.
\end{example}


\begin{definition}
A topological space $X$ is said to be $\mathbf{triangulable}$ if there exists a simplicial complex $T$ and a homeomorphism $\phi : |T| \to X$. The triple $(T,X, \phi)$ is called a \textbf{triangulation} of $X$. In this situation we will simply say that $T$ is a triangulation of $X$, by abuse of notation.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
A \textbf{PL space} is a pair $(X,\mathcal{T})$ consisting of a topological space $X$ and a class $\mathcal{T}$ of locally finite triangulations of $X$ which satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $T \in \mathcal{T}$ then $T' \in \mathcal{T}$ for any subdivision $T' \lhd T$.
\item If $T,T' \in \mathcal{T}$ then there exists $T'' \in \mathcal{T}$ such that both $T'' \lhd T$ and $T'' \lhd T'$.
\end{itemize}
We will simply write $X$ for a PL space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ if there is no danger of confusion. A \textbf{closed PL subspace} of $X$ is a subcomplex of a suitable triangulation of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given simplicial complexes $K$ and $L$ we call a map $f: |K| \to |L|$ \textbf{simplicial} if $f$ maps each simplex of $K$ linearly onto some simplex of $L$. A map $g: |K| \to |L|$ between PL spaces  is said to be a \textbf{PL map} if there exist subdivisions $K' \lhd K$ and $L' \lhd L$ such that $g: K' \to L' $ is simplicial.
\end{definition}
Note that a simplicial map $f: K \to L$ is given by linear extension of a (set-theoretic) function $V(K) \to V(L)$.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{simplicial isomorphism} between two simplicial complexes $K$ and $L$ is given by a bijection $f : V(K) \to V(L)$ such that $[v_0,...,v_k]$ is a $k$-simplex in $K$ if and only if $[f(v_0),...,f(v_k)]$ is a $k$-simplex in $L$. In particular, extending $f$ linearly yields a homeomorphism between the underlying polyhedra $|K|$ and $|L|$. A map $g: |K| \to |L|$ between PL spaces is a \textbf{PL isomorphism} if there exist subdivisions $K' \lhd K$ and $L' \lhd L$ such that $g: |K'| \to |L'|$ is a simplicial isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{0-dimensional PL stratified pseudomanifold} is a countable set of points with the discrete topology. An \textbf{n-dimensional PL stratified pseudomanifold} $X$ is a PL space together with a filtration of closed PL subspaces
\begin{equation*}
X=X_n \supset X_{n-1} = X_{n-2} \supset ... \supset X_0 \supset X_{-1} = \emptyset
\end{equation*}
such that the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every $X_{n-k} - X_{n-k-1}$ is a (possibly empty) PL manifold of dimension $n-k$.
\item $X-X_{n-2}$ is dense in $X$.
\item \textbf{Local normal triviality:} For every point $x \in X_{n-k} - X_{n-k-1}$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$  in $X$ and a compact PL stratified pseudomanifold $L$ of dimension $k-1$ with filtration
\begin{equation*}
L = L_{k-1} \supset L_{k-3} \supset ... \supset L_0 \supset L_{-1}= \emptyset
\end{equation*}
and a PL isomorphism
\begin{equation*}
\phi : U \to \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \times c^{\circ} L
\end{equation*}
(where $c^{\circ}$ denotes the open cone) which restricts to PL isomorphism $\phi_| : U \cap X_{n-l} \to \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \times c^{\circ} L_{k-l-1}$. We say that $\phi$ is \textbf{stratum-preserving}.
